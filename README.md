SMS Spam Checking using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
SMS Spam Checking

This repository demonstrates SMS spam checking using two popular machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The aim is to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content. This project can be used to build a robust SMS spam filter.

Introduction
SMS spam checking is essential for filtering out unwanted messages and ensuring that users only receive legitimate SMS messages. In this project, we explore two machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, to build models that can effectively classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. It is stored in a CSV file named sms_dataset.csv. Each message is associated with a label (1 for spam and 0 for ham).
